To apply the VCG (Vickrey-Clarke-Groves) mechanism, we need to determine the optimal allocation of seats on the bus among the three people, such that their total utility is maximized. The mechanism requires each participant to submit a preference list of the cities they want to visit, and the cost they are willing to pay for each possible allocation.

First, we need to calculate the total utility of each person for each possible allocation. 

For simplicity, we can represent the allocations using binary strings, where a "1" in the i-th position indicates that the i-th person occupies a seat on the bus, and a "0" indicates they do not. We also need to take into account the cost of each allocation.

The possible allocations and their costs are:

000 (no one goes on the tour) -> 0 euros
001 (only Sara goes to Torino) -> 400 euros
010 (only Paola goes to Milan) -> 150 euros
011 (Sara goes to Torino, Paola goes to Milan) -> 550 euros
100 (only Alessia goes to Genoa) -> 200 euros
101 (Alessia goes to Genoa, Sara goes to Torino) -> 600 euros
110 (Alessia goes to Genoa, Paola goes to Milan) -> 350 euros
111 (Alessia goes to Genoa, Sara goes to Torino, Paola goes to Milan) -> 750 euros

Now we need to calculate the utility of each person for each allocation. We can use their preference lists to assign a score to each allocation based on the cities they visit:

Alessia: 4 if she visits Milan, 5 if she visits Turin, 1 if she visits Genoa, 0 otherwise.
Paola: 3 if she visits Milan, 5 if she visits Genoa, 0 otherwise.
Sara: 5 if she visits Milan, 2 if she visits Genoa, 0 otherwise.

Using these scores, we can calculate the utility of each person for each allocation:

000: Alessia = Paola = Sara = 0
001: Alessia = Paola = 0, Sara = 5
010: Alessia = Paola = 3, Sara = 0
011: Alessia = Paola = 3, Sara = 5
100: Alessia = 1, Paola = Sara = 0
101: Alessia = 5, Paola = 0, Sara = 5
110: Alessia = 4, Paola = 3, Sara = 0
111: Alessia = 4, Paola = 3, Sara = 5

Next, we need to calculate the total utility of each possible coalition, i.e., each combination of people that could form a winning coalition. We can use the Shapley value to assign a share of the total utility to each person in the coalition, based on their contribution to all possible sub-coalitions.

The possible coalitions and their Shapley values are:

Alessia: 001 (0), 100 (1/3), 101 (1/6), 110 (1/6), 111 (1/6) -> total utility = 3.83
Paola: 010 (0), 110 (1/3), 111 (1/3) -> total utility = 2.83
Sara: 001 (1), 011 (1/2), 101 (1/2), 111 (1/2) -> total utility = 6.67

Finally, we can calculate the VCG payment for each person in each possible allocation. 
The VCG payment is the difference between the total cost of the allocation and the cost of the allocation without the person, minus the sum of the Shapley values of all other people in the coalition.

For example, for the allocation 111 (Alessia goes to Genoa, Sara goes to Turin, Paola goes to Milan), the total cost is 600 euros, and the cost without Alessia is 400 euros. The Shapley values for Paola and Sara in the coalition {Sara, Paola} are 1/2 and 1/2, respectively. Therefore, the VCG payment for Alessia in this allocation is:

VCG payment for Alessia = (600 - 400 - 1/21/22.83) - (600 - 300 - 1/2*6.67) = 33.28 euros

Similarly, we can calculate the VCG payment for Paola and Sara in each allocation. The results are:

VCG payment for Alessia: 000 (0), 001 (0), 010 (0), 011 (50), 100 (0), 101 (0), 110 (33.33), 111 (33.28)
VCG payment for Paola: 000 (0), 001 (0), 010 (0), 011 (0), 100 (0), 101 (75), 110 (66.67), 111 (66.67)
VCG payment for Sara: 000 (0), 001 (200), 010 (0), 011 (66.67), 100 (0), 101 (200), 110 (0), 111 (0)
Therefore, the optimal allocation according to the VCG mechanism is 011 (Sara goes to Turin, Paola goes to Milan), with a total cost of 150 euros and a total utility of 8. The VCG payments for each person are:

Alessia: 50 euros
Paola: 0 euros
Sara: 100 euros


Note that in this allocation, each person gets their highest ranked city, and the total utility is maximized. The VCG payments ensure that the mechanism is truthful, i.e., each person reports their true preferences, because lying could only hurt their chances of being included in the winning coalition, but not their payment.



The Shapley value is used in the VCG mechanism to calculate the payments that each participant should receive in the mechanism. The VCG mechanism is a type of incentive-compatible mechanism, which means that it incentivizes participants to report their true preferences. The mechanism achieves this by assigning payments to the participants that are proportional to the harm caused to other participants by their participation in the mechanism.

The Shapley value is a concept from cooperative game theory that measures the contribution of each participant to the coalition. In the VCG mechanism, the Shapley value is used to measure the marginal contribution of each participant to the coalition's cost. Specifically, the VCG payment for each participant is equal to the difference between the total cost of the coalition with the participant and the cost of the coalition without the participant, minus the sum of the Shapley values of all other participants in the coalition.

The use of the Shapley value in the VCG mechanism ensures that the payments are fair and incentive-compatible, because they reflect the actual contribution of each participant to the coalition's cost. Furthermore, the Shapley value is a well-established and widely-used concept in cooperative game theory, so its use in the VCG mechanism is theoretically sound and well-supported.
