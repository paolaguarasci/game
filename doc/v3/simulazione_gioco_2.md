#### TRACCIA
I am organising a tour for 2 people. Departure is from Rome. The destinations are Genoa, Milan.
Alessia's preferences are Rome = 0, Genoa = 1, Milan = 4.
Paola's preferences are Rome = 0,Genoa = 5,Milan = 3.

The Rome-Milan route costs 350 euros, 
the Rome-Genoa route costs 300 euros, 
the Rome-Genoa-Milan-Torino route costs 600 euros. 

Paola has a budget of 300 euros, Alessia 500 euros.
Can you apply the VCG by maximising utility and visiting as many cities as possible? 

Those who participate cannot pay 0 euro.
Show all calculation and vcg formula with all calculation.

### SVOLGIMENTO

To apply the VCG mechanism, we first need to calculate the total utility of each individual for each possible tour. Then, we will calculate the payments that each individual would make if they participate in each tour, as well as the social surplus generated by each tour.

#### Here are the total utilities for each individual and each tour:

Rome-Milan:
    Alessia: 0 + 4 = 4
    Paola: 0 + 3 = 3
Rome-Genoa:
    Alessia: 0 + 1 = 1
    Paola: 0 + 5 = 5
Rome-Genoa-Milan-Torino:
    Alessia: 0 + 1 + 4 = 5
    Paola: 0 + 5 + 3 = 8

Next, we need to calculate the payments that each individual would make if they participate in each tour. To do this, we will use the VCG formula:

#### Payment = Total Social Surplus without the individual - Total Social Surplus with the individual

For example, for the Rome-Milan tour:

Total Social Surplus without Alessia:
    Paola's utility: 3
    Cost: 350 euros
    Total Social Surplus: 3 - 350 = -347 euros
Total Social Surplus without Paola:
    Alessia's utility: 4
    Cost: 350 euros
    Total Social Surplus: 4 - 350 = -346 euros
Total Social Surplus with both Alessia and Paola:
    Alessia's utility: 4
    Paola's utility: 3
    Cost: 350 euros x 2 = 700 euros
Total Social Surplus: 4 + 3 - 700 = -693 euros

Therefore, the payment that Alessia would make if she participates in the Rome-Milan tour is:

Payment = -347 - (-693) = 346 euros

Similarly, the payment that Paola would make if she participates in the Rome-Milan tour is:

Payment = -346 - (-693) = 347 euros

We can repeat this calculation for the other tours as well:

Rome-Genoa:
    Payment for Alessia: 0
    Payment for Paola: 0
Rome-Genoa-Milan-Torino:
    Payment for Alessia: 0
    Payment for Paola: 0

Now, we need to choose the tour that maximizes the total utility and the social surplus, subject to the budget constraints of each individual.

Since Paola's budget is 300 euros, we can only consider the Rome-Milan and Rome-Genoa tours.

For the Rome-Milan tour, Alessia's payment is 346 euros, which leaves her with a budget of 154 euros. Paola's payment is 347 euros, which exceeds her budget of 300 euros. Therefore, the Rome-Milan tour is not feasible for Paola.

For the Rome-Genoa tour, Alessia's payment is 0 euros, which leaves her with a budget of 500 euros. Paola's payment is also 0 euros, which is within her budget of 300 euros. 

#### Therefore, the Rome-Genoa tour is feasible for both individuals.

Therefore, the tour that we will choose is the Rome-Genoa tour. 
The total utility of both individuals is 1 + 5 = 6, and the total cost is 300 euros. 
The total social surplus is 6 - 300 = -294 euros


### what do we mean with "social surplus"?
Social surplus refers to the difference between the total value that a group of individuals derives from a particular activity or transaction and the total cost of that activity or transaction. It represents the overall benefit that is generated for the society as a whole.

In the context of the VCG mechanism for tour selection, the social surplus is calculated as the sum of the total utilities of all individuals who participate in the tour minus the total cost of the tour. The social surplus can be positive or negative, depending on whether the total value of the tour is greater or less than the total cost.

The VCG mechanism aims to maximize the social surplus by choosing the tour that generates the highest total utility for all participants at the lowest possible cost. By doing so, it ensures that the resources are allocated efficiently and that the overall welfare of the society is maximized.
