I am organising a tour for 3 people.
Departure is from Rome. 
The destinations are Genoa, Milan, Torino. 
I have 3 people.
Alessia's preferences are Rome = 0, Genoa = 1, Milan = 4,Turin = 5;
Paola's preferences are Rome = 0,Genoa = 5,Milan = 3,Turin = 0
Sara's preferences are Rome = 0,Genoa = 2,Milan = 5,Turin = 0

The Rome-Milan route costs 150 euros, the Rome-Genoa route costs 200 euros, the Roma-Torino route costs 400 euros, the Rome-Genoa-Milan route costs 300 euros, the Rome-Genoa-Milan-Torino route costs 600 euros. Paola has a budget of 300 euros, Alessia 500 euros, Sara 400 euros. Can you apply the VCG by maximising utility and visiting as many cities as possible? Those who participate cannot pay 0 euro. If a player does not participate in the tour he pays 0 euros.
-------------------

Sure, we can apply the VCG mechanism to allocate the seats in the most efficient way. To do so, we need to determine the optimal assignment of seats that maximizes the total utility of the participants subject to their budget constraints. We also need to compute the externality that each participant generates by joining or not joining the tour, which is the difference in total utility between the optimal assignment with and without that participant.

To maximize utility and visit as many cities as possible, we can consider the following possible routes:

Rome-Genoa-Milan-Torino: total cost=600 euros, total utility=10+8+10=28
Rome-Genoa-Milan: total cost=300 euros, total utility=10+8=18
Rome-Milan-Torino: total cost=150+400=550 euros, total utility=4+10=14
Rome-Genoa: total cost=200 euros, total utility=10=10

Given the participants' budgets, the possible routes that are affordable for each of them are:

Alessia: Rome-Genoa-Milan-Torino, Rome-Genoa-Milan, Rome-Genoa, Rome-Milan-Torino
Paola: Rome-Genoa-Milan, Rome-Genoa, Rome-Milan-Torino
Sara: Rome-Genoa-Milan, Rome-Genoa, Rome-Milan-Torino

To apply the VCG mechanism, we need to compute the externality generated by each participant joining or not joining the tour, assuming that the other participants join the tour. This means that we need to compute the difference in total utility between the optimal assignment with and without each participant, considering the routes that are affordable for the other participants.

For Alessia: 
    with=Alessia+Paola+Sara = 10+5+8 = 23, cost=500; 
    without=Paola+Sara=5+8=13, cost=250; 
    externality=23-13=10.

For Paola: 
    with=Alessia+Paola+Sara = 10+5+8 = 23, cost=300; 
    without=Alessia+Sara=1+8=9, cost=150; 
    externality=23-9=14.

For Sara: 
    with=Alessia+Paola+Sara = 10+5+8 = 23, cost=350; 
    without=Alessia+Paola=1+5=6, cost = 250; 
    externality=23-6=17.

Therefore, according to the VCG mechanism, 
    Alessia should pay the difference in total utility between the optimal assignment with and without her, which is 10 euros. Paola should pay 14 euros, and Sara should pay 17 euros. This assignment ensures that each participant has an incentive to truthfully report their preferences and budgets, and results in an efficient allocation of resources.
To determine how much each player has to pay under the VCG mechanism, we first need to calculate the external cost that each player imposes on the others.

Alessia: The total cost of the tour with Alessia's participation is 600 euros (Rome-Genoa-Milan-Turin route), and the total cost of the tour without her participation is 450 euros (Rome-Milan-Turin route). Therefore, the external cost that Alessia imposes on the others is 150 euros.

Paola: The total cost of the tour with Paola's participation is 500 euros (Rome-Genoa-Milan route), and the total cost of the tour without her participation is 450 euros (Rome-Milan-Turin route). Therefore, the external cost that Paola imposes on the others is 50 euros.

Sara: The total cost of the tour with Sara's participation is 550 euros (Rome-Genoa-Milan-Turin route), and the total cost of the tour without her participation is 450 euros (Rome-Milan-Turin route). Therefore, the external cost that Sara imposes on the others is 100 euros.

Now we can calculate how much each player has to pay:

Alessia: She has to pay the external cost she imposes on the others, which is 150 euros.

Paola: She has to pay the external cost she imposes on the others, which is 50 euros.

Sara: She has to pay the external cost she imposes on the others, which is 100 euros.

Therefore, Alessia has to pay 150 euros, Paola has to pay 50 euros, and Sara has to pay 100 euros under the VCG mechanism.
