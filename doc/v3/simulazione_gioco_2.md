#### TRACCIA
I am organising a tour for 2 people. Departure is from Rome. 
The destinations are Genoa, Milan.
Alessia's preferences are Rome = 0, Genoa = 1, Milan = 4.
Paola's preferences are Rome = 0,Genoa = 5,Milan = 3.

The Rome-Milan route costs 350 euros, 
the Rome-Genoa route costs 300 euros, 
the Rome-Genoa-Milan route costs 600 euros. 

Paola has a budget of 300 euros, Alessia 500 euros.
Can you apply the VCG by maximising utility and visiting as many cities as possible? 

Those who participate cannot pay 0 euro.
